        <p>Afghanistan needs help, this war-stricken nation and its people have endured so much during their lifetimes. Now they need help to rebuild and take steps forward in improving their country. This help can be as simple as donating a dollar a month, to going overseas to help deliver humanitarian aid. But no matter how small, every penny, every dollar, and every person helping, is another stride in creating a better Afghanistan, and overall a better world. Please consider these charities for your donations. <a href="https://www.goabroad.com/articles/volunteer-abroad/how-to-help-afghan-refugees
