        <p>Snow leopards have been labeled as a vulnerable species, and only about 100-200 Snow leopards are left in the  Afghanistan wild. These leopards are being overly hunted, their habitat being destroyed, and illegal poaching. This means that their already small population will decrease even further and increases the possibility that we will lose the Afghan snow leopard forever with every inch of habitat and every bit of fur we take.

        <p> These stunning cats are an ever-softening whisper of Afghan life and culture. We need to protect these leopards and preserve their role in Afghanistan for generations to come. Our actions have just as big an impact on the world around us as we do on ourselves. We can choose to protect our environment, to make sure that we are not the proprietors of our and our world's destruction.
