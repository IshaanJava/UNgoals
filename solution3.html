        <p>40% of Afghans have food insecurity. This means that 16 million people are at risk of starvation at some point in their daily lives. Afghanistan's war-torn history has led its citizens down a path of poverty and devastation. Almost half of the country lives below the poverty line, not able to provide for themselves and their families. Leading to millions of families going hungry every day.

        <p>Environmental issues make an already pressing issue all the more dangerous. The country is especially mountainous, and rainfall is scarce in most places. These factors increase exponentially the risks of hunger in Afghanistan due to farming becoming an ever-challenging occupation, which is even further continued by changing climate, leading to an arid country becoming increasingly more unfarmable.
