        <p>Afghanistan ranks dead last in gender equality. Women are oppressed daily and are deprived of basic human rights because of the Taliban's machiavellian rule of Afghanistan. Many cannot go to school, hold jobs, or even go out in public without a male. Any breach of these restrictive laws often results in brutal and inhumane punishments, from public flogging to even death, just for women trying to be equal to men.

        <p>These acts, forcing women to be silent in the home are only hurting the world. Some of Afghanistan's most intelligent minds, artistic hands, and powerful voices are being squandered under the harsh rule of the Taliban. They are depriving the world of some of the greatest people simply because of their gender, something completely arbitrary. These Afghan women should be allowed to live their lives as they choose, with no governing body dictating that.
